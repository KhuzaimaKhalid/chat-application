Dummy Data Generator 🚀

A tiny, no-fuss dummy JSON data generator for testing APIs, databases, or frontend mockups. Perfect for when you need realistic-looking sample data fast. 🧪💾

What it is 🧩

This repository contains a simple Node.js script (main.js) that generates dummy JSON documents you can use for development and testing. Run it to produce fake but sensible-looking objects in bulk — great for seeding, demos, or playing with data-driven UI. ✨

Features ✅

Generates JSON dummy documents quickly

Easy to run from the command line

Outputs to stdout so you can redirect to a file (e.g. > data.json)

Simple to customize (edit main.js to change fields / structure)

Prerequisites ⚙️

Node.js (v12+ recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

Number of items generated

Field names and value patterns

Output format (pretty vs compact JSON)

Notes 📝

node_modules/ is in .gitignore — don't commit dependencies.

Meant for development/testing only (not production data).
